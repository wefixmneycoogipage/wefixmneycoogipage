A stretch loan is a form of financing for an individual or business that can be used to cover a short-term gap. In effect, the loan "stretches" over that gap, so that the borrower can meet financial obligations until more money comes in and the loan can be repaid. When offered by a federal credit union they may be called payday alternative loans (PALs).
