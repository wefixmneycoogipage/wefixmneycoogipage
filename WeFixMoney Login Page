For an individual, a stretch loan works much like the more familiar payday loan. With a payday loan, the borrower uses the money to cover basic living expenses or other bills until their next paycheck arrives. At that point, the borrower can, ideally, pay off the loan. Payday loan applications are subject to simple credit checks, and the loans are typically offered by small, but regulated, credit merchants. Payday loans are also notoriously expensive, with annualized interest rates that average 400%, depending on the state.2 Some states have now outlawed payday loans or restricted the amount of interest they may charge.
