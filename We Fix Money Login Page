A business might take out a stretch loan to provide it with working capital for a short period of time. For example, suppose a small company wants to buy fresh inventory to restock its warehouse but hasn't yet collected a large accounts receivable balance from one of its major retail customers. The company could take out a stretch loan from its bank to finance the inventory purchase. Then, when it collects on the outstanding accounts receivable, it can pay back the stretch loan.

The maximum loan amount will be limited by the lender and the interest rate will be higher than the rate for a normal working capital loan. A small business might not already have a working capital facility in place because, for example, it lacks sufficient assets to serve as collateral.
